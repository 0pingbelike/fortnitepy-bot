ok so when you have downloaded the bot go into config.json and put an alt epic email account and password make sure to have the bot 
added on your main so when it comes online you can invite the bot to your game after save config.json and run 'install packages'
after that start the bot and BOOOOOOOOM your bot should now be online 

if it asks for the AUTH code go to this web address (https://www.epicgames.com/id/logout?redirectUrl=https%3A//www.epicgames.com/id/login%3FredirectUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.epicgames.com%252Fid%252Fapi%252Fredirect%253FclientId%253D3446cd72694c4a4485d81b77adbb2141%2526responseType%253Dcode)
and sign in with the alt account that you put into the config.json and then this should appear ({"redirectUrl":"https://accounts.epicgames.com/fnauth?code=hd9ghdf9df75hfd9h5d9dh599h5d9h59d","sid":null})

                                                                                                                       COPY EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS EXAMPLE (hd9ghdf9df75hfd9h5d9dh599h5d9h59d)

and then go back to the CMD and paste that into there and you should now be done
